1. NAs
   using the drop_na command i removed all the NA values, i would have used a more specific column by column removal if i knew what data i was trying to observe
   there is no point removing the data in a row where the data i need to use is fine and a not used variable is an NA
   instead of drop_na() i could use drop_na("column")

2. duplicates
   used the get_dupes() to display the duped data and then filtered it out in the lines below, making the new data set.

3. -ves where there shouldnt be e.g. -93 body mass - impossible values 
   some mosquitp mass seems too low however it isnt -ve, so im not sure whether they should be removed or whether it should be kept
  ive decided to remove the extreme low outliers in the low end.
  
4. inconsistent spellings


5. dates are inconsistent
